    <h1>Swim for your life</h1>

    <p>
        Life is a journey, not a destination. Might as well enjoy the swim.

        Some other things I have learned:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Love the one your with.</li>
        <li>Life is like a box of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chocolate">chocolates</a>. You never know
            what you're gonna get.</li>
            <li>If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.</li>
        </ul>
